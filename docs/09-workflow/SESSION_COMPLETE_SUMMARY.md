## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well 🌟
1. **Parallel Development**: 3 teammates working simultaneously maximized output
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Writing tests first reduced debugging time
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Features shipped as they completed
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: 145 tests ensured high quality
5. **Clear Communication**: Regular status updates kept everyone aligned
6. **Proper Git Workflow**: Feature branch, not direct master commits

### Challenges Overcome 💪
1. **Windows Compatibility**: Fixed pre-commit hook (python3 → python)
2. **Model Schema Mismatches**: Fixed field names in mistake model
3. **Test Mock Complexity**: Simplified unit tests where possible
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented custom token bucket algorithm
5. **Analytics Dependencies**: Documented tech debt, delivered working core features

### Technical Debt ⚠️
1. **Analytics Test Infrastructure**: Integration tests need expansion (documented)
2. **Frontend Dashboard UI**: Analytics stats page not implemented (can be Phase 2)
3. **E2E Testing**: End-to-end tests not written (can be added later)
4. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger could be enhanced
